# ICT3909 - Optimisation of Saliency-driven Image Content Ranking Parameters
B.Sc IT (Hons) Artificial Intelligence FYP Thesis


In todayâ€™s digital age where the photograph is paramount in attention retention and interest stimulation, the need for a mathematical model capable of approximating visual attention and
ranking objects based on how salient they are, i.e., how much prioritisation they garner from the human visual system, is becoming ever more prevalent.
CNN-based models have dominated the field of saliency map generation in the past decade. 

This study aims to optimise the components of <a href="	https://www.um.edu.mt/library/oar/handle/123456789/90087" target="_blank"><b>SaRa</b></a>, a saliency estimation technique which estimates the saliency ranking of objects in images using a non-deep-learning grid approach, and evaluate it accordingly.
Evaluation is carried out both quantitatively, by comparing the improved technique to current state-of-the-art models on the Salient Object Ranking (SOR) metric, as well as qualitatively.
An experiment is conducted wherein participants are asked to click on the parts of news website interface images which grab their attention the most, and their mouse movements are tracked. This data is used to create a dataset estimating human visual attention, to which the results generated improved technique are compared. 

The proposed optimisations are found to be successful, achieving a SOR score of 0.715 on a subset of the SALICON dataset, proving comparable to state-of-the-art performance and resulting in an increase of 0.061 when compared to the original technique.

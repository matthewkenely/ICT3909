# ICT3909 - Optimisation of Saliency-driven Image Content Ranking Parameters
B.Sc IT (Hons) Artificial Intelligence FYP Thesis


In today’s digital age where the photograph is paramount in interest stimulation, news
outlets engage in constant competition for our attention. Thus, the need for a saliency
model capable of approximating visual attention and ranking objects based on how much
prioritisation they garner from the human visual system is becoming ever more preva‐
lent.

While the application of saliency to traditional photographs has seen rapid de‐
velopment in recent years, its application to user interfaces has been scarce. The aim of
this project is two‐fold: to optimise an existing saliency ranking framework (SaRa) which
could measure attention distribution fairness by organising interface elements into ranks
and evaluate it accordingly; and to curate a dataset which conveys inter‐element saliency
relationships and can be used to evaluate SaRa qualitatively.
The dataset was curated through the collection of gaze location data within news
website interfaces using an eye‐tracker as well as an online experiment where mouse tra‐
jectories were tracked. Participants were split into two groups, with each of these groups
having excessively salient elements either included or removed, with the discrepancy be‐
tween them serving as an indicator of how distracting the excessively salient elements
were.

Quantitative evaluation is carried out by comparing the improved technique to
current state‐of‐the‐art models on the Salient Object Ranking (SOR) metric. The pro‐
posed optimisations are found to be successful, achieving a SOR score of 0.718 on a
subset of the SALICON dataset, proving comparable to state‐of‐the‐art performance
and resulting in an increase of 0.064 when compared to the original technique.

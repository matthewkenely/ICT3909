# ICT3909 - Optimisation of Saliency-driven Image Content Ranking Parameters
B.Sc. IT (Hons) Artificial Intelligence FYP Thesis

In today’s digital age where the photograph is paramount in attention retention and interest stimulation, 
there is an ever‐increasing need for a mathematical model of the
human visual system which can approximate visual attention and, hence, the most relevant parts of images. 
Saliency is a sub‐problem of computer vision (a subfield of machine
learning concerned with the automatic processing and interpretation of images) which
attempts to tackle the creation of such a model. When an object within an image is considered 
salient by a model, it means that the model approximates that object to garner
prioritisation from the human visual system.

This concept of visual prioritisation implies that objects in an image can be organ‐
ised into ranks, from smallest (most salient) to largest (least salient). In 2018, Seychell
<i>et al.</i> developed <a href="	https://www.um.edu.mt/library/oar/handle/123456789/90087" target="_blank"><b>SaRa</b></a>,
an approach which allows for the automatic ranking of the
saliency of objects within images without the prior need of a trained model. This approach
splits images into a grid and ranks each segment individually. The aim of this
project is to analyse how varying the parameters to this technique affects the generated
content ranking results, and optimise the components which make up <b>SaRa</b> accordingly.

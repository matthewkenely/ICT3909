# ICT3909 - Optimisation of Saliency-driven Image Content Ranking Parameters
B.Sc. IT (Hons) Artificial Intelligence FYP

In 2018, Seychell <i>et al.</i> developed <a href="	https://www.um.edu.mt/library/oar/handle/123456789/90087" target="_blank"><b>SaRa</b></a>, an approach which allows for the automatic
ranking of the saliency of objects within images without the prior need of a trained model.
This approach splits images into a grid and processes each segment individually. The aim of this project is to analyse how varying the parameters to this technique (grid size, score formula weights, image resolution) affect the generated content ranking results, and optimise the components which make up <b>SaRa</b> (saliency map generator).

## Introduction
In 2018, Seychell et al. developed <a href="	https://www.um.edu.mt/library/oar/handle/123456789/90087" target="_blank">SaRa</a>, an approach which allows for the automatic
ranking of the saliency of objects within images without the prior need of a trained model.
This approach splits images into a grid and processes each segment individually. The aim
of this project is to analyse how varying the size of this grid, as well as the resolution of the
input images, affects the generated content ranking results, and optimise the parameters
of SaRa accordingly.
